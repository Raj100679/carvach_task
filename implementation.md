This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in web development and showcases the capabilities of Next.js for building modern web applications.

Features:

Header: The header component provides navigation links to different sections of the application. It prominently displays the logo and ensures easy access to various pages.
Sidebar: The sidebar offers additional options and functionalities, enhancing the user experience by organizing content and providing quick access to important features.
Form: The form component allows users to input their information, facilitating interaction and data collection. It demonstrates the ability to handle user input and process data within the application and it logs the details of the user to the console.

Technologies Used:

Next.js: Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing, providing a solid foundation for building scalable web applications.
React: React.js is utilized for building reusable UI components, making the application modular, efficient, and easy to maintain.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for styling the components, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive design.
react-icons: The react-icons library is employed to include icons, such as the close icon (FaTimes), enhancing the visual presentation and user interaction of the application.
Responsive Design:
The application is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. Whether viewed on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices, the layout adjusts dynamically to provide an optimal viewing experience.

Assumptions:

To make my web app responsive, I assumed that as the screen size shrinks, the sidebar will expand to occupy the full available width. Additionally, the links on the navbar/header will transform into a hamburger-type icon, with a sleek animation for toggling between the hamburger and close icons.

For the form located at the bottom, I reduced its width to enhance the overall UI aesthetics. As for the logo, I opted for the Carvach logo to maintain brand consistency throughout the application.

Deployment:
The application is deployed to Netlify, allowing it to be accessed easily via the web. You can visit the deployed application at https://carvach.netlify.app/.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project showcases my web development skills and highlights my ability to create strong, user-friendly applications.
